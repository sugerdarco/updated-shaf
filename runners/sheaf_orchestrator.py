"""
SheafOrchestrator — the per-token decode loop for agents with DIFFERENT tokenizers.

The project previously carried a shared-tokenizer orchestrator, which compared
amplitude vectors token-for-token and fed one `input_ids` tensor back to every
agent. That variant has been removed; this one drops the shared-tokenizer
assumption, so both of those steps work differently:

  comparison   agents' vectors are over different vocabularies and different
               lengths, so they are pushed onto a shared byte-prefix tree first
               and compared per node (Stage 8).
  feedback     there is no shared token id to append. The consensus is a byte
               chunk; it is appended as TEXT and every agent re-encodes the
               extended context with its own tokenizer.

Everything else is deliberately the same, and where it is the same it reuses the
repo's code rather than reimplementing it:

  Stage 1  `sahf.amplitude.softmax_to_amplitude`, called inside `UpstreamAgent`.
  Stage 2  `sahf.gate.mean_entropy` and `pairwise_amplitude_spread`, applied to
           the agents' byte-level root sections. Same GateThresholds, same
           two-factor Path A / Path B routing.
  Stage 5  chordal mean, per tree node.
  Stage 6  MAD outlier screen, per tree node, same `mad_multiplier` as config_sheaf.yaml.
  Stage 7  Weiszfeld geometric median, per node, only where Stage 6 fires.

Stages 5/6/7 run as numpy transcriptions inside `reconciler.py` because they
execute per node -- hundreds of times per token -- where torch's per-call
overhead would dominate. `tests/test_sheaf_parity.py` pins them numerically to
`sahf.fusion` and `sahf.robust`.

Path A here means "fuse with the plain mean and skip the robust machinery
entirely", exactly as Path A in the fast version skips fusion; it does not skip
building the tree, because without the tree there is no shared space in which to
read off a next token at all.

The per-step record keeps the fast version's field names (`path`, `escalated`,
`entropy`, `divergence`) so existing log tooling and `out/runs/*/steps.jsonl`
readers keep working, and adds Stage 8 fields alongside them.
