"""
Stage 8 / part 5 -- end-to-end pipeline.

    agents (own tokenizers)
        -> next-token distributions
        -> union byte-prefix tree            [prefix_tree]
        -> per-node local sections in sqrt-space
        -> Stage 5 mean, Stage 6 screen, Stage 7 escalation -- per node
        -> glued global section over bytes   [sheaf]
        -> consensus bytes  +  per-agent token distributions for the next step

Two modes, matching the deck's cascading-cost principle:

  "topk_union" (default)
      Build the tree per step over the union of each agent's top-k ids. Those
      ids are what Stage 2 already computes for its cheap summaries, so Stage 8
      rides on data the pipeline pays for anyway.

      `k` defaults to 16 on benchmark evidence (docs/BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md): with
      three real tokenizers, output quality is FLAT from k=8 to k=256 while cost
      grows 23x. The ceiling on a single step is the mean token length (~3.3
      bytes) -- past its own token boundary an agent has no information, so a
      wider k adds competitor tokens, not lookahead.

  "full"
      One static tree over the complete vocabularies, built once and reused for
      every step. No tail truncation.

      OFFLINE EVALUATION ONLY. On three real 32k tokenizers the union tree is
      207k nodes and a step costs 1.5-3.5 SECONDS. It cannot be used in a
      decoding loop.
