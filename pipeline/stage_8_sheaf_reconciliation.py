"""
Stage 8 / part 3 -- local sections, gluing, and the trip back to token space.

The sheaf picture the deck describes, made concrete:

  base space      the byte-prefix tree's nodes (byte strings s)
  stalk at s      a distribution over the next BYTE, given the prefix s
  local section   one agent's conditional at s, defined only on the open set
                  where that agent still has mass to continue with
  restriction     parent -> child edge; restricting is conditioning one byte on
  gluing          agents agree on overlaps => one global section over the tree,
                  recovered by chaining conditionals down from the root

Token distributions over different vocabularies cannot be averaged -- they live
in different spaces. Conditionals at a shared byte node live in the SAME
256-simplex for every agent, so Stages 5/6/7 apply unchanged, per node.

WHY THE TOKEN BOUNDARY IS MARGINALIZED OUT
------------------------------------------
A node splits an agent's cover mass two ways: mass that continues to a further
byte, and mass that stops because one of its tokens ends exactly here. It is
tempting to fuse "stop" as a 257th symbol alongside the 256 bytes. That is
wrong, and wrong in a way that quietly corrupts the consensus.

Take agents predicting the same text " the". Agent A holds " the" as one token;
agent B holds " th" then "e". At node " th", A continues with 'e' while B stops.
Fusing "stop" as a symbol reports a 50/50 split -- a manufactured disagreement
about where a tokenizer draws its boundaries, not about what comes next. The two
agents in fact agree completely.

So a stop is read as a HORIZON, not a vote: B has simply run out of what one
forward pass can tell us. B leaves the support at deeper nodes and A carries the
prediction. Boundaries are tokenizer artifacts, and keeping them out of the
fused result is the entire point of Stage 8.

Boundaries return only where they belong -- in `project_to_vocab`, where the
consensus content is re-segmented by each agent's own tokenizer.
