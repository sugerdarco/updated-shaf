"""
Stage 2 — Divergence Gate.

Decides, per decoding step, whether the agents already agree (cheap Path A) or
need real fusion (Path B). Two conditions must both hold for "agree":
  - H  (entropy of the mean consensus distribution) < theta_H  — the group as a
    whole is confident about *something*.
  - D  (max pairwise spread between agents' amplitude vectors) < theta_D — the
    agents are confident about the *same* thing.

Either condition failing routes the token to Path B. This mirrors the two-factor
consensus criterion used in "When to Ensemble" (SAFE, arXiv:2510.15346): fusing
every single token is both slower and measurably worse (distributional drift) than
fusing only where it's actually needed.
